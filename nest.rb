  def caveats; <<-EOS.undent
    Clang does not support OpenMP!
    Building NEST with Clang enforces --without-openmp!
    Since current versions of clang fail to build NEST, GCC has to be installed
    on this system (e.g. via `brew install gcc`).

    GCC might have to be built without multilib to make openmp work correctly!
      see https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60670
    Either build NEST without openmp support,
      brew install nest --without-openmp,
    or (re)install GCC without multilib support,
      brew reinstall gcc --without-multilib
